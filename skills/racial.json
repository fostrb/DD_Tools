        "desc": "This Skill allows you to simulate a specific type of athletic feat. When you choose this Skill you must choose one of the following; Strength, Agility, or Endurance. You gain a level of mastery of that type of Athletics. Use of this Skill requires a Plot Marshal. When using this Skill you must tell a Plot Marshal what you are trying to do, along with your Athletic Speciality. The Plot Marshals will then tell you how much Stamina and time you need to expend to make that happen (between 1 and 5 Stamina). Spend the Stamina and the time (if there is any) and you are able to complete the feat. This Skill cannot be used while you are actively engaged in Combat or as a response to any type of Attack. You may only ever purchase this Skill Once. Any Skill you have can be used as an additional Keyword to use in conjunction with Athletics, though only 1 additional Keyword per attempt action. In addition to the above this Skill allows you to spend Stamina on baseline things you can do during Combat. For Strength you can spend 1 Stamina to do +1 Melee Damage for 1 Minute. For Agility you can spend 1 Stamina to do +1 Ranged Damaged for 1 Minute. For Endurance you can spend 1 Stamina to gain a Soak of +1 for 1 Minute (Soaks cannot reduce damage to less than 1).",
