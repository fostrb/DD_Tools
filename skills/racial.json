These questions are considered to be asked In Game, and represent you catching the person you at talking with off-guard. An individual may use Negotiate on any single Target only Once Per Period. The following is a list of questions that may be asked.\n1. At Any Time - After 10 minutes of Roleplay with the Target you gain an Influence Card for the Target\u2019s Faction. This can only be done Once Per Hour, and is at the discretion of the NPC (if you spent 10 minute yelling at the NPC it is unlikely you gained Influence)\n2.
