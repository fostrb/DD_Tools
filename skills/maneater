name: Not Food
cost: 2
freq: periodic
type: special
lists: Maneater:General
desc: Allows you to mark a Human Target with your blood such that they will not be seen as food to other Maneaters for the remainder of the Period. As long as the Target does not initiate Combat with or in any way instigate a Maneater, a Maneater cannot initiate Combat with the Target. This is considered a mental Attack for the purposes of overcoming protection. A Maneater will not give this protection to a Human on a whim, for, if the human transgresses against other Maneaters while protected the Maneater who gave him the mark will likely find his life as forfeit. This is considered as a lesser form of the Blood Marking.
