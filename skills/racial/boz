freq: permanent
type: special
lists: Boz:Asteroid_Miner
desc: Requires Marshal. This Skill allows you to create a hole in a wall through which you and whoever you choose may enter. Indicate the area you wish to put a hole. The Marshal will give you a time between 2 and 20 minutes. This is the time you must spend opening the hole. RP for opening the hole must be appropriately loud. Once a hole has been opened, only you may give access to its use, and my only grant access so long as you have a hand on the wall near where the hole is. This hole lasts so long as you remain within sight of the hole, and have the active ability to grant access to the hole. When passing through the hole, all Targets go Out of Game and appear on the other side of the wall directly on the other side of where the “hole” would be. Certain walls, such as energy barriers, cannot be Breached. This Skill is effected by anything that would reduce Crafting Time, but can never be reduced to less than 2 minutes.
