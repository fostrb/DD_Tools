desc:  When a Target within Melee Range of you utilizes a Skill, or is the Target of a Skill, you may call “Suckle” to duplicate that Skill on yourself. This only applies to Skills whose effect is instantaneous, and whose conditions you are able to meet. So, you could not Suckle "Hide" unless you were already within Cover. Likewise you could not Suckle "Defensive Stance" unless you had a Shield. You cannot Suckle any Skill that is offensive in nature. You cannot Suckle a Suckle.

name: Pick Pockets
cost: 4
freq: periodic
type: special
lists: Elysian:General
desc: – Allows you to steal an object from a Target’s pocket. Requires a Marshal to be present before utilizing this Skill. Interact with Target for 1 minute. At some point within that minute you must lay a hand on the pocket you wish to steal from for at least 5 Seconds (this need not be continuous). The Marshal will then go to the Target to indicate that they have been Pick Pocketed. If the pocket you wish to steal from is in a place that common decency would not allow you to touch, you must inform the Marshal and they will indicate the area you must touch in order to complete the transaction. You may indicate to the Marshal that you are looking to steal a specific object from the Target’s pocket, if the Target has that object in that pocket you receive it. Otherwise, you just get one random object in the Target’s pocket. Unless one has a Defense against Pick Pocketing, the Skill is generally undetectable… however as this is a Marshaled Skill, the Marshal may base your success on how you interacted with the Target. This Skill may also be used to place an item in someone’s pocket.

desc:  All Schemes started by you that directly involve the Elysium or Elysians or any property directly owned or operated by Elysians cost half Influence rounded up to a maximum discount of 10 Influence, whichever is less (for example if the Scheme costs 9 you this Skill would reduce the cost to 5, half rounded up. If the Scheme costs 40 Influence, this skill would reduce the cost to 30 as this is the maximum discount you can receive). This Skill does apply to all Standard Schemes. Direct involvement with the Faction in question is up to the discretion of the Plot Marshal, however a general rule of thumb regarding this is as follows; if the Scheme is primarily about or primarily involving the Faction it is good, if the connection is tangential, it is not.
